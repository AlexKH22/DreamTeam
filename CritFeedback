Crit Feedback:

Crit 1
You can make the data up, the model can fit any data.
Don't wait on the data from BMW.
Visit the dealership.
Thinking about the right time to introduce our solution in the customer's sale cycle.
Speak to BMW owners.
Be very clear on the number of products that BMW has to offer.
Be specific about price of each product.

Crit 2
Customize bundles:
We can inquire the inherent correlation of the products. If with confident of the product, bundles will have good effects:
The bundle is necessary: people are incited when they could get the benefit (They fill the survey and get the discount of BMW care.) Like Jet.com.
Also, we can make different level of bundles instead of different contents of bundles: e.g Luxury bundle includes everything; recommend bundle, and bundle with very limit function(incite people to buy recommended bundle)

About How to make personalize:
Personalize service should be specific: shows you care the clients
It could be luxury service, detailed information

About the position of the chart (statistical marketing):
It could appear in the margin

Crit 3:
Diagnosis system:
It is a good idea that not only involve the data about public choice, but also involves the cost-saving method.  (It is good to post the upper bound )
Review: Put it on the product is more persuasive.
Expansion: It is not a good idea to apply the method to the whole car industry while it is still immature.
Time to explain: It is necessary to explain BMW care and ancillary product before the demo.
