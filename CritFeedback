Customize bundles:
We can inquire the inherent correlation of the products. If with confident of the product, bundles will have good effects:

Also, we can make different level of bundles instead of different contents of bundles: e.g Luxury bundle includes everything; recommend bundle, and bundle with very limit function(incite people to buy recommended bundle)
