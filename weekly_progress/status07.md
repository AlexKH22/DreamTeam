Company Challenge:
How might we make buying ancillary products more personalized online?


This week:

1. Completed 'Sprint 2'.
2. Built a prototype memory-based recommendation engine.
3. Came up with an mvp of our design and where our tool will be placed on the BMW site.


Week Ahead:

1. Continue working on prototype of recommendation engine.
2. Come up with product bundles.
3. Examine feedback from Sprint 2


Risks:

Bundles might be tougher to group than previously thought.
