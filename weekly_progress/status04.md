Company Challenge:
How might we make buying ancillary products more personalized for online customers?

This week:

1. Met with Chris, our studio advisor and went over all the feedback we have received.  
2. Agreed on a recommendation system and certain product bundles.
3. Finished system architecture diagram.
4. Agreed on a team and personal goals.
5. Agreed on a development process.

Week ahead:

1. Research details for recommendation system.
2. Gather data on historical ancillary product data.
3. Gather existing data on BMW owners and drivers.
4. Plan initial product bundles.


Risks:

1. Robustness of recommendation system.
2. Enough data for recommendation system.
